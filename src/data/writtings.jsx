"Why should you donate to the Baptist Academy CBSE Building Project?",
"Your donation directly supports the construction of the school, with no overhead costs except for financial institution transaction fees. It has an immediate and profound impact on the lives of the children who thrive in our school. With dedicated and caring teachers, your donation towards completing the school buildings directly benefits the children, transforming their lives.",
"In India, one US dollar equals about 80 Indian rupees, making construction and living costs significantly lower. Your contribution goes a long way in India. While renovating a bathroom may cost over $10,000 elsewhere, in India, you can build one with just $1,000. Your donation will be maximized, creating a lasting impact.",
"This is a one-time school building project. Once completed, we will no longer seek financial assistance. Our goal is to make the school self-supporting and sustainable. We prioritize the school's long-term development and aim to provide education to more students. By donating, you enable us to expand our reach and positively impact the lives of many children.",
"We are committed to full transparency and accountability. Every dollar received will be used solely for building the school. As volunteers, we do not receive any compensation for our work. We dedicate our time and resources because we believe deeply in the importance of this cause.",
"The school building is currently halfway completed, and funding has run out. Without further construction, the school faces the risk of ruin and damage, and all the progress achieved thus far will be lost. It is crucial that we continue the construction to its completion. We urge you to seriously consider donating and assure you that your contribution will be greatly appreciated and make a significant difference in the lives of countless Indian children.",
"Your support is invaluable, and we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your sacrificial giving. Together, let us create a brighter future for the children."

export const HistoryContent=["A History of God's Faithfulness","The Baptist Academy Group of Schools is a ministry that operates in affiliation with the South India Baptist Bible College and Seminary (SIBBC&S). Its establishment is deeply intertwined with the history of SIBBC&S.", "In 1983, Dr. P.D. Cherian founded SIBBC&S with a specific purpose: to train Christian workers and reach lost souls for Christ. Seeking God's guidance, Dr. Cherian and his wife devoted an entire year to prayer, and their direction became clear through Isaiah 43:19: \"Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.\"", "The journey of SIBBC&S has been filled with challenges. The college began humbly with only seven students, but over the next five years, it grew in size and impact despite adversities faced in a hostile environment. Questions arose regarding finances, accommodations, classroom and housing space, and infrastructure. However, God provided miraculously, with a friend offering a building at a nominal rent of 200 rupees (less than $4) per month. The first year saw the enrollment of seven students, and every month, finances were met to cover the basic needs of the students and faculty. Dr. Cherian contributed his personal library to the college, and a returning missionary friend provided furniture and hymn books, essential equipment for starting the college.", "During the subsequent five years, additional buildings were rented, and the college expanded to over 32 students and six full-time faculty members. The students actively engaged in soul-winning, Bible studies, Sunday school, church services, and church planting ministries in the surrounding areas, despite facing adversities such as water and electricity shortages, as well as threats and harassment from locals. In the midst of struggles, many individuals found salvation and put their trust in the Lord.", "As the college continued to grow, the existing facilities became inadequate. Consequently, SIBBC&S purchased 11 acres of farmland, which included two large poultry sheds that were converted into multifunctional spaces serving as classrooms, dormitories, libraries, kitchens, and dining halls.", "To effectively empower the ministry and ensure accountability, Internal Partnership Ministry (IPM) joined as a mission board to support SIBBC&S. IPM played a crucial role in facilitating the ministry's tremendous growth and development.", "In 1993, the need for a men's dormitory became urgent as the poultry sheds could no longer accommodate the students. The Larry Cook residence hall for men was constructed, providing accommodation for 250 men at a cost of less than â‚¹200 per square foot.", "In 1994, the Baptist Academy CBSE Schools began with 11 children and 2 teachers. Additionally, the South India Baptist Matriculation School started in 1996 with 20 students and two teachers. Today, both schools continue to serve as powerful tools to reach lost children and their parents. The Academy has received numerous prestigious awards, including the \"Best School Award\" for many years.", "In 1997, student dining hall has been completed. Up until then, students had been picking up their food and carrying it outside where they had to stand and eat their meals in the open air.", "Another significant milestone in the history of SIBBC&S was the establishment of the ministry Home of HOPE, which stands for \"Helping Orphans Prepare for Eternity.\" In a country with one of the world's largest populations, countless abandoned and orphaned children exist. The first child brought into this loving atmosphere was Joshua Daniel, abandoned at birth and taken in by Mrs. Cherian in December 1998. Subsequently, many children in similar situations joined the family. Currently, 25 beautiful children are being raised in an environment that meets their spiritual and physical needs.", "SIBBC&S stands as a living testament to the unwavering faithfulness of the Lord. Dr. Cherian aptly stated, \"When you are personally involved in a miracle, you never get over it.\" The ministry's expansion has been made possible through the grace of God, supported by prayer partners and generous financial contributors. Numerous churches and individuals have bestowed substantial gifts, facilitating the development of the campus and construction of classroom buildings. Presently, the SIBBC&S campus spans over 20 acres, with an additional 10 acres designated for future expansion.", "As of the 2023 academic year, SIBBC&S accommodates over 600 boarders, while the Baptist Academy Matriculation School and Baptist Academy CBSE School serve 650 and 181 students, respectively. Additionally, the \"HOME OF HOPE\" orphanage has nurtured and cared for 25 children.", "Since its birth, SIBBC has been on a mission to cultivate and nurture local churches. SIBBC&S has been supporting 114 pastors scattered throughout different regions of India. The impact of SIBBC&S graduates extends far and wide, with over 600 churches sprouting not only across India but also in neighboring lands like Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, Sikim, Bangladesh, China, and the Anda Islands. Many dedicated alumni continue to impart their wisdom and train workers in these very areas, ensuring the seeds of faith flourish and bear fruit.", "SIBBC&S continues to grow. With prayers and sacrificial contributions, all things are made possible."];
export const AMiracleWellContent=["A Miracle Well", "South Indian Baptist Bible College and Seminary is filled with remarkable examples of answered prayers. In 1988, when the college relocated to its current locationâ€”an arid, desert-like areaâ€”finding safe drinking water became a pressing concern. Although there were existing wells on the property, the available water was highly contaminated. The only viable option was to drill a new well, with no guarantee of success.", "Interestingly, the neighboring community had drilled seven wells in close proximity to the college, but not a single one produced water. However, with God, all things are possible. Through His provision of funds, SIBBC&S promptly engaged a company to carry out the drilling.", "Before commencing the drilling process, the faculty, staff, and laborers of SIBBC&S gathered on the side to read God's word and pray. As the drilling began, a crowd from the community gathered, eagerly observing the proceedings. Despite drilling down to a depth of 400 feet without success, they persisted. Dr. P.D. Cherian, the college's founder, instructed the contractor to drill an additional 50 feet. Even after this extension, no water was found. The growing crowd of spectators watched intently. Dr. P.D. Cherian then directed the contractor to drill another 25 feet, making it a total of 475 feet.", "At this point, unbelievers in the vicinity started doubting Jehovah God's ability to answer prayers, thinking that He was just as powerless as their own gods. The driller, convinced there was no point in drilling further, expressed his skepticism. Sensing the doubts of the onlookers, Dr. P.D. Cherian was moved by the Holy Spirit to seek the Lord in prayer. Joined by Professor Babu Baggies and a student from SIBBC&S, they knelt down beside the well and fervently prayed, asking God to provide water in the well for the sake of their neighbors' belief in Him.", "The drilling had been ongoing throughout the day, and it was now around 5:30 am. Emboldened by the Lord, Dr. P.D. Cherian urged the contractor to drill a few more feet, despite his equipment being limited to an additional 10 feet. Reluctantly, the contractor agreed to make a final effort and drilled another 5 feet. To their astonishment, water gushed up 40 feet into the air. In that triumphant moment, Dr. P.D. Cherian turned to the onlookers and spectators, proclaiming the greatness of their true and living God who answers prayers. Heads nodded in agreement, acknowledging that their God was indeed real and alive. It was a time of immense jubilation.", "To the glory of God, SIBBC&S brought in a survey company to assess the well's capacity. For a staggering 18 hours, they pumped water from the well at a rate of 3000 gallons per hour. The company suspects the presence of an underground river beneath the campus. Since 1988, SIBBC&S has relied on this miraculous well, consistently drawing water at the remarkable rate of 3000 gallons.", "This miracle well stands as a testament, fulfilling both the spiritual and physical aspects of Isaiah 43:19 in the ministry of SIBBC&S: \"Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.\"", "Let us praise the Lord for His faithful answers to prayer, as He continues to bring glory to His name."];
