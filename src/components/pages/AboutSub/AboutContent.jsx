        Welcome to our website, dedicated to raising funds to complete the
        construction of the Baptist Academy Group of Schools in Coimbatore,
        India. We aim to create a self-sustaining educational institution that
        provides a quality education for generations to come.

        The Baptist Academy Group of Schools was founded by Dr. P. D. Cherian in
        1994, following the establishment of the South India Baptist College and
        Seminary (SIBC&S). With over 20 acres of land and an additional 10 acres
        for expansion, the SIBC&S has enough space to host multiple schools. Dr.
        Cherian saw the need for a quality, well-rounded secondary education for
        children in Coimbatore and established the Baptist Academy Group of
        Schools, which includes a CBSE school and a Matriculation Higher
        Secondary School.

        Our schools' motto, "Sowing Seeds of Potential," reflects our belief
        that every child is born with potential, and it is the duty of educators
        to help children find that potential and grow it through our Core
        Values. Our schoolsâ€™ mission is not only to cater to a child's
        educational needs, but also to their physical fitness, artistic
        ingenuity, emotional well-being, and foster their knowledge of God.
        Beyond academic excellence, we aim to mold our students to develop godly
        character and to live as law-abiding citizens.

        Our schools provide a range of programs and activities, including Music,
        Art and Crafts, Cooking and Gardening, Red Cross, Karate, Scouts &
        Guides, Field Trips, Electronics, and Robotics, all of which encourage
        students to become engaged and compassionate lifelong learners.
