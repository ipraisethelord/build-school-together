# deploy from vs code:

# npm run build

# npm run preview, if everything is fine, type control + c, terminate the preview.

# commit your files to the github.

# deploy using the code instead of github auto build and deploy because we need env.production file

# to get the client_id. The .env.production is not uploaded to the github

# npm run deploy

# it takes a while the deploy is completed even though you see published from your terminal

#
